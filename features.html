			<h2>Australia has cheerleaders?</h2>
			<p>
				Cheerleading is one of the newest styles of dance to boom in Australia. Stereotypically the first thing that comes to mind are bitchy American teens, who wave their pom poms, chant "go, team, go" and throw people in the air. Well, as a cheerleader myself, I can tell you it is a whole lot more than that.
			</p>
			<p>
				Jessica Nugent, Present of the La Trobe Eagles Cheer leaders and part owner of "Atomic Allstars Cheer’ has been a part of the cheer community for 6 years. Although the sports history in Australia started well before this it was still very small and unheard of, although the growth since Jess' presence has skyrocketed.
			</p>
			<p>
				"My first comp was at winterfest and there would have been a couple of hundred competitors, compare that to now and there is something like 2,500+, which is crazy." 
			</p>
			<p>
				With each competition, more clubs are progressively popping up, inviting schools and universities to get involved, as seen through La Trobe University and local high schools such as Santa Maria College.
			</p>
			<p>
				But why is it that this style is taking off? According to Maria Davis, part owner and founder of Atomic,
			</p>
			<p>
				"Cheerleading is something new and different. It’s performance-based, so you still get to dress up and compete, but it's also hugely fitness focused, which makes it attractive to people looking to perform, get fit, or combine the two."
			</p>
			<p>
				As any competitive sport, many hours of hard work and dedication are put into preparing athletes for competitions. Having a safe and encouraging environment is foremost important to Maria and Jess, a bearing which lead to them starting up the gym.
			</p>
			<p>
				"[We wanted to] be a gym that did things the right way, to have long term growth and progress... cheer has really become such a huge part of [our lives] that it's a bonus to be doing something [we] love as work."
			</p>
			<p>
				With the evolutionary growth of the sport, it is evident that cheer leading is an addictive sport, so addictive that it lead Maria and Jess to starting a business dedicated athletes achieving their best. This style of dance, like any, has no age limits, whether it be learning level one stunts or feeling like you are ready to audition for the next "Bring it on" sequel, the cheer community encourages everyone to give it a go. Cheer is a new, fun, feel good sport which I suggest you don't knock until you try.

			<h2>Dance just for fun</h2>
			<p>
				With child obesity on the rise, parents are encouraged to start good habits of fitness and wellbeing from a young age. Dance (any genre) is a fun and social recreational activity where children can develop new skills and make new friends whilst exercising. Azra Susic, a contemporary jazz dancer from Dance Explosion, has been a student since she was 11. Azra shared her thoughts with me about what dance means to her, and why she choose it as a hobby.
			</p>
			<p>
				For Azra, dance means freedom. It is about providing a way to express herself while also incorporating exercise and fitness in an interesting way.
			</p>
			<p>
				The reason that Azra chose dance over other recreational activities is because she simply loved to dance.
			</p>
			<p>
				"I wanted to get better at dancing [she laughs], as well as not looking like I had two left feet! I stayed in dance, because I'd make a commitment to do the concert, and then the same thing would happen every semester; I just recommit. Honestly I think a major reason I chose it, but more importantly stuck to it, is because I enjoy it more and more, as I continue to do it and that's why it gets picked over other activities."
			</p>
			<p>
				Many dancers share the same philosophy as Azra where dance is one of those things that you are never too old to do.  Her passion for dancing truly flourished after she returned to class after a a few years break.
			</p>
			<p>
				"I was only going to do it for a year or two during high school but I just continued. It's my break, from the other things that go on around me. Dance makes me happy, and I don't want to give it up just because I got a bit older. It keeps up my fitness, and helps me become more flexible."
			</p>
			<p>
				The benefits of dance to Azra are that it is an amazing workout and is a way to keep her fit in a fun and enjoyable way. Her technique and skills are always improving and a great sense of accomplishment is felt when you can "finally hit that turn". It helps her to open up and be more confident.
			</p>
			<p>
				On the down side, like any sport, you can be injured. Azra likes to consider all the bumps and bruises as war wounds.  Like the saying goes, there will always be someone else out there better than you and this is no different with dance.
			<p>
				"You can be easily intimidated by how good others around you are, but personally, it motivates me to be better."
			</p>
			<p>
				Dance has the power to make you feel a raft of emotions.
			</p>
			<p>
				"It's what I love, so it’s all the feelings that come wrapped up anything  that you love, whether that be happiness, frustration or motivation."
			</p>
			<p>
				In terms of an active hobby, Azra most definitely recommends it. It's a fantastic way to keep fit, try new things, get flexible, but also to meet great people.

			<h2>Dance within the medium of reality television shows</h2>
			<p>
				Reality  television shows, those irritating series that we love to hate, yet hopelessly get sucked into watching whilst eating a bag of chips on a boring Friday night, have been produced on about absolutely everything and dance is no different.  Ranging from the putrid, gob smacking but strangely addictive ‘Dance Moms’ to the inspiring and tasteful ‘So You Think You Can Dance’,  viewers are now exposed to dance in a whole new experience; providing more mediums and opportunities for aspiring dancers or those with an interest in the art to laugh, cry and admire.
			</p>
			<p>
				Alanah Casamento, a senior jazz and tap student of mine watches most, if not all series related to dance. Last Wednesday night, a discussion sparked upon the most recent American season of So You Think You Can Dance. Delving into the topic further Alanah freely raved about the amazing choreography of the dances and how the performers inspire her because
			</p>
			<p>
				“they learn dances so quickly and execute them with such technique, even if it isn’t their preferred style of dance.”
			</p>
			<p>
				After class I decided to pull Alanah aside to ask her a few more questions about reality dance television shows and what they mean to her from a dancers perspective.
			</p>
			<p>
				The key factors for Alanah when looking to watch a good quality dance show are simple. It has to have good dancers and good choreography.
			</p>
			<p>
				“I think choosing an appropriate song for the dance style and storyline has an impact on the performance as well.”
			</p>
			<p>
				Alanah sees a real benefit in watching reality dance projects because
			</p>
			<p>
				“It projects good portrayals of dance. SYTYCD (as an example) has everyday people dancing, and it shows that you can make it as a professional dancer if you persist and work hard. I don’t think anything bad comes from watching these programs as they are enjoyable to watch and as a dancer you can get ideas for your own dancing.”
			</p>
			<p>
				Watching dance shows like SYTYCD and ABC hit Dance Academy gives young dancers like Alanah increased ambitions within their dance. Reality dance shows have inspired Alanah and those who love the art of dance, to develop her dance knowledge, technique and creativity beyond the studio. These shows provide fresh and energetic ideas for class.
			</p>
			<p>
				“Even if it is just incorporating an arm or something which I saw in a show into one of our dances… Watching them I can try to better my technique and skill by watching their feet, arm line and so on.“
			</p>
			<p>
				Through this quick discussion with Alanah it was prevalent that although we (as dancers) watch these shows for pleasure, there is a criteria to which they must uphold, in this case, a high standard of choreography and dance. These show sets an achievable standard where young students strive to meet the excellence of these ‘real people’ who share a passion for the art of dance.

			<h2>Robert McNamara: Dance is life Part One</h2>
			<p>
				Robert McNamara is the Director of Darebin School of Dance. He was a professional dancer for over 25 years and has been running the northern suburbs school for 21 years. Over  a few coffees, I spoke to Robert about his experiences as a dancer, the owner and director of a ballet school and his latest endeavors of designing a new syllabus and becoming an examiner.
			</p>
			<p>
				Robert explained to me that he started dancing at around 5 or 6 at a tap school in Broadmeadows, crying on his first lesson.
			</p>
			<p>
				“What a sook I was. [he laughs] And all because the girl over the road did it [danced] and my parents thought it would be a good idea for me to learn.”
			</p>
			<p>
				After discovering ballet was his preferred dance style he moved to the Corrie Lodders school in North Fitzroy. As he got older he was dancing at the Kew Ballet Centre, Australian Ballet School (for a very short time) then went on to dance professionally in Australia and overseas.
			</p>
			<p>
				Robert semi-retired at age 35, but continued to dance in musical theatre productions. In musical theatre it’s important to acquire the triple threat: singing, acting and dancing. Robert was more than eager to showcase his range of talents and by doing so provided many work opportunities.
			</p>
			<p>
				“I was wondering what I was going to do with all this dance background.  I spoke with a friend who I had started Dance Theatre of Victoria with some years before telling her I was thinking of starting a school.  She suggested I speak with Nadine as she had expressed the same interest and that is how Darebin School  of Dance got started.”
			</p>
			<p>
				The school opened in 1992 with three teachers and one student for a few weeks. They taught for an hour on Saturday, which is unheard of, with his day stretching out to 8 hours of class. The school started to attract more students and they built it up to what it is today.
			</p>
			<p>
				“It has its ups and downs like any dance school.  The population can be somewhat transient but you will always have a core of students that remains reasonably constant.”
			</p>
			<p>
				With the growth and sustained culture of the 21 year old lifespan of the school, Robert has seen almost everything you could with teaching dance. So I asked, What are the benefits of dance to youth?
			</p>
			<p>
				“Mainly self-discipline, body awareness and creativity. The self-discipline comes with having to turn up for class sometimes 6 days a week, taking on board the corrections given and utilising them to improve technique. Like any physical activity that uses a technique constant repetition improves the dancer until it becomes 2nd nature.”
			</p>
			<p>
				As a dancer you will be corrected for the rest of your dancing life.  Being aware of your body and what you are doing is primal to improvement.
			</p>
			<p>
				“Body awareness allows the dancer to recognise when something is wrong physically and also allows the dancer to create the line so important in dance.  For this reason we use mirrors to watch our every move and improve our technique and art.”
			</p>
			<p>
				When an injury occurs a dancer should know exactly what caused it, the location and how to fix the problem, although sometimes a visit to an external source is necessary. Due to the nature of dance, dancers are prone to injuries  and this is another important reason to have body awareness.
			</p>
			<p>
				“The dancer can work around the injury if it is minimal.  The safest option is to go see someone so the injury is not aggravated.”
			</p>
			<p>
				Creativity is the cornerstone of dance.
			</p>
			<p>
				“Our imaginations are used to the fullest constructing a ballet, creating the mood, choreography, design, music, all play a part and the creative part of our brain can literally run wild if allowed to do so.  Fortunately having a ballet school I have  full creative control but do need to keep a bit of reign on some of my ideas.”
			</p>
			<p>
				Dance is a wonderful way to express emotion, explore your creativity and invest your body into self-discipline.

			<h2>Robert McNamara: Dance is life Part Two</h2>
			<p>
				With majority of dance schools, classes are split into two parts of the year; learning technique and preparing students for exams. The other half of the year is spent preparing students for an end of year concerts where they showcase the new skills learnt throughout the year.
			</p>
			<p>
				Robert recently became an examiner for the State Dance Association which he described as being
			</p>
			<p>
				“A really big thrill. I get the chance to visit other school and examine the students.  My criteria in examination is to always encourage the students and to make them feel reasonably comfortable in an exam situation.”
			</p>
			<p>
				As an examiner Roberts job is to critique the students but with a positive attitude in the written reports. He has been known to give a correction in an exam but only to help the student in future. Robert chooses this method as it makes examiner seem a little more like just another 	teacher.
			</p>
			<p>
				Over the past two years, Robert has been working on developing the new classical syllabus for the State Dance Association (which has now been published and distributed to SDA schools around Victoria.)
			</p>
			<p>
				“This is an achievement I am very proud of. Knowing there are schools teaching exercised I created is unbelievable.”
			</p>
			<p>
				Robert is a glowing example of how you can make a successful, lifelong career out of dance.
